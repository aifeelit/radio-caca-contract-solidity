## What is Radio Caca?

- Radio Caca is the exclusive manager of Maye Musk Mystery Box (MPB) NFT and governance token for The USM Metaverse.

- The USM is an MMO 3D Mapping Metaverse with the same style of Decentraland. However, we have a real 3D Planet where users can zoom in and zoom out dynamically inside and around the planet.  This feature is the first ever to be shown on the game market globally.

- Radio Caca launched <Metamon> on the BSC in October 2021. It’s a “Play To Earn” game where RACA plays the role of “AXS” in AXIE Infinity. Metamon game will be expanded into the Universal Metaverse later (USM).
